            Hey there, this is Anshuman.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are on this page. You are interested in using Collegebasket
            or are interested in working with me. I am really sorry that the app
            has not been maintained recently. I got busy with JynxIt.us right
            after collegebasket so didn't had much time for maintainence. I
            would take care of it as soon as I catch a breath.<br />
            If you are interested please ask me for older build or status at
            theduplatform@gmail.com. Or if you are interested in hiring me then
            take my word for the App it is awesome see

            and I was praised many times for my UI and UX design. I did
            everything on my own. <br />Thanks for stopping by <br /><br />A
            restless developer <br />
